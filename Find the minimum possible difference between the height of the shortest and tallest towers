Problem: Given an array arr[] denoting heights of n towers and a positive integer k . For each tower, you must perform exactly one of the following operations exactly once. 
Increase the height of the tower by k Decrease the height of the tower by k . Find out the minimum possible difference between the height of the shortest and tallest towers after you have modified each tower. 
You can find a slight modification of the problem here. 
Note: It is compulsory to increase or decrease the height by k for each tower. After the operation, 
the resultant array should not contain any negative integers. 
 
Examples :  
Input: k = 2, arr[] = [1, 5, 8, 10] 
Output: 5 
Explanation: The array can be modified as [1+k, 5-k, 8-k, 10-k] = [3, 3, 6, 8]. The difference 
between the largest and the smallest is 8-3 = 5. 
Input: k = 3, arr[] = [3, 9, 12, 16, 20] 



Code: class Solution:
          def getMinDiff(self, arr, k):
              n = len(arr)
              if n == 1:
                 return 0

              arr.sort()
        
              ans = arr[-1] - arr[0]

              smallest = arr[0] + k
              largest = arr[-1] - k

              for i in range(n - 1):
                   min_height = min(smallest, arr[i + 1] - k)
                   max_height = max(largest, arr[i] + k)

                   if min_height < 0:
                      continue

                   ans = min(ans, max_height - min_height)

               return ans
